# Pledge Buy Contract

Trustless permissionless smart contract for making a trade (on Balancer) as a group!

Specify:
- Which token you want to buy
- Which token you want to sell
- The target minimum amount of the buy token to buy
- An acceptable price threshold (maximum amount of sell token to sell per target amount of buy token bought)
- A deadline

The contract then accepts commitments to buy the buy token using the sell token.
If the target is reached by the deadline, the trade can be executed.
Then everyone who participated can claim their portion of the bought buy token.
If the target is not reached by the deadline, everyone who committed sell token can refund their commitment.

## Cool features

- Immutable permissionless design: no admins, no upgrades, anyone can play
- Contract does not hold any funds (they are sent straight to the Balancer Vault internal balance)
- Works with any ERC20s (for which a Balancer pool exists for doing the trade)
- Written in fewer than 256 lines of Vyper for security and readability

# Smart Contract Interface

## Actions

### create
`create((bytes32 poolId, uint256 deadline, address buyToken, uint256 minBuy, address sellToken, uint256 maxSellForMin), uint256 buyTokenIndex, uint256 sellTokenIndex) → uint256 id`

Create a new pledging agreement for people to participate in.

#### Arguments
- `poolId`: the identifier for the Balancer pool in which to execute the swap.
- `deadline`: the Unix time (in seconds) after which the pledging agreement expires.
- `buyToken`: the ERC20 token we are pledging to buy.
- `minBuy`: the target minimum amount of `buyToken` to buy.
- `sellToken`: the ERC20 token we are selling in order to buy `buyToken`.
- `maxSellForMin`: the maximum amount of `sellToken` to sell for each `minBuy` portion of `buyToken`. In other words, the maximum price at which to buy `buyToken` is `maxSellForMin ÷ minBuy`.
- `buyTokenIndex`: the token index of `buyToken` in the `poolId` pool's tokens (as returned by `getPoolTokens(poolId)` on the Balancer vault).
- `sellTokenIndex`: the token index of `sellToken` in the `poolId` pool's tokens.

#### Returns
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement, used to refer to this agreement in future calls.

#### Emits
- `Create(uint256 indexed id, address indexed buyToken, address indexed sellToken, uint256 minBuy, uint256 maxSellForMin, uint256 deadline)`

#### Errors
- `"deadline"`: if the `deadline` is in the past (before `block.timestamp`).
- `"minBuy"`: if the `minBuy` is zero.
- `"buyToken"`: if the `buyToken` does not correspond to the `buyTokenIndex` token in the `poolId` pool.
- `"sellToken"`: if the `sellToken` does not correspond to the `sellTokenIndex` token in the `poolId` pool.

### pledge
`pledge(uint256 id, uint256 amount)`

Commit `amount` of `sellToken` to the pledging agreement `id`.

#### Arguments
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement.
- `amount`: the amount of `sellToken` to commit.

#### Emits
- `Pledge(uint256 indexed id, address indexed caller, address indexed amount)`

#### Errors
- `"expired"`: if the `deadline` has already been reached (is before or equal to `block.timestamp`).
- `"executed"`: if the agreement has already been executed.
- `"transferFrom"`: if `amount` `sellToken` tokens could not be transferred from the caller. The pledging contract needs to have an allowance of at least `amount` tokens approved by the caller.
- `"approve"`: if the pledging contract fails to approve the Balancer vault to spend its `sellToken` tokens.

### execute
`execute(uint256 id) → uint256 buyAmount`

Execute the trade of `sellToken` for `buyToken` represented by the pledging agreement `id`.

#### Arguments
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement.

#### Emits
- `Execute(uint256 indexed id, uint256 indexed sellAmount, uint256 indexed buyAmount)`

#### Returns
- Returns the amount, `buyAmount`, of `buyToken` bought.

#### Errors
- `"id"`: if `id` does not refer to a created pledging agreement.
- `"expired"`: if the `deadline` has already been reached (is before or equal to `block.timestamp`).
- `"executed"`: if the agreement has already been executed.
- `"minBuy"`: if the `buyAmount` is not at least the `minBuy` amount.
- `"price"`: if the price for the sale is greater than `maxSellForMin ÷ minBuy`.

### claim
`claim(uint256 id) → uint256 buyAmount`

Claim the portion of the `buyToken` tokens obtained via a successfully executed pledging agreement `id` owed to the caller.

#### Arguments
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement.

#### Emits
- `Claim(uint256 indexed id, address indexed caller, uint256 indexed buyAmount, uint256 sellAmount)`

The amounts `buyAmount` and `sellAmount` in this event are the portions of the trade executed for `caller` particularly, not the total amounts.

#### Returns
- The amount, `buyAmount`, of `buyToken` claimed by the caller.

#### Errors
- `"id"`: if `id` does not refer to a created pledging agreement.
- `"pending"`: if the agreement has not yet been executed.
- `"empty"`: if the caller did not commit any `sellToken`.
- `"transfer"`: if the transfer of `buyToken` to the caller fails.

### dust
`dust(uint256 id) → uint256 dustAmount`

Claim any remaining `buyToken` tokens left over due to rounding errors after all claims have been made on the pledging agreement `id`.

#### Arguments
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement.

#### Emits
- `Dust(uint256 indexed id, address indexed caller, uint256 indexed dustAmount)`

#### Returns
- The amount, `amountDusted`, of `buyToken` left over due to rounding and transferred to the caller.

#### Errors
- `"id"`: if `id` does not refer to a created pledging agreement.
- `"active"`: if the agreement's deadline has not yet passed.
- `"pending"`: if the agreement has not yet been executed.
- `"claimants"`: if there is any outstanding claim of `buyToken` to be made by an account that committed some `sellToken` to the agreement.
- `"empty"`: if there is no leftover `buyToken` dust to be claimed.
- `"transfer"`: if the transfer of `buyToken` to the caller fails.

### refund
`refund(uint256 id) → uint256 refundAmount`

Return the `sellToken` tokens committed by the caller to an expired pledging agreement `id`.

#### Arguments
- `id`: the identifier for the pledging agreement.

#### Emits
- `Refund(uint256 indexed id, address indexed caller, uint256 indexed refundAmount)`

#### Returns
The amount, `refundAmount`, of `sellToken` refunded to the caller.

#### Errors
- `"id"`: if `id` does not refer to a created pledging agreement.
- `"active"`: if the agreement's deadline has not yet passed.
- `"executed"`: if the agreement has already been executed.
- `"empty"`: if the caller has not committed any (non-refunded) `sellToken`.
- `"transfer"`: if the transfer of `sellToken` to the caller fails.
